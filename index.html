        <h3>Cloud Operations Engineer</h3>
<p><strong>Company:</strong> Digitall</p>

<div class="role-description">
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> As a Cloud Operations Engineer at Digitall, I oversee and support all aspects of the SAP NEO environment across multiple global data centers, spanning over 20 landscapes and managing more than <strong>30,000 virtual machines</strong>. I participated in  migration to <strong>SLES 15</strong>, ensuring operational stability, performance, and minimal service disruption throughout the transition.</p>

  <p>I work extensively with major public cloud providers — including <strong>Google Cloud</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>, <strong>Alibaba Cloud</strong>, and <strong>AWS</strong> — leveraging <strong>Cloud Foundry</strong> to manage, deploy, and scale applications across diverse environments. This multi-cloud exposure strengthens system scalability, security, and resilience.</p>

  <p>I collaborate closely with development teams to perform advanced troubleshooting, analyze system logs, and resolve complex issues efficiently, maintaining adherence to internal and external <strong>SLAs</strong>. I also support <strong>post-mortem analysis</strong> processes, providing actionable insights that help development teams improve platform reliability and product performance.</p>

  <p>A major highlight of my role includes contributing to the <strong>Apache Camel 3.x migration</strong> project — successfully transitioning multiple VMs to Camel 3.x with minimal downtime across SAP landscapes.</p>

  <p>To further enhance operational efficiency, I actively <strong>automate workflows and procedures</strong> using tools like <strong>Jenkins</strong>, <strong>Autopilot</strong>, and other CI/CD solutions, streamlining deployments and reducing manual intervention.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Collaborate closely with development and platform teams in a global, fast-paced environment.</li>
    <li>Continuously learn and integrate new technologies to drive innovation and system improvement.</li>
    <li>Perform deep troubleshooting and log analysis to identify and resolve critical infrastructure issues.</li>
    <li>Ensure timely, high-quality support and resolution for requests aligned with defined SLAs.</li>
    <li>Lead post-mortem reviews and provide feedback loops for continuous improvement.</li>
    <li>Design and enhance platform monitoring, automated recovery, and performance optimization frameworks.</li>
    <li>Automate deployment and operational processes using <strong>Jenkins</strong>, <strong>Autopilot</strong>, and internal DevOps pipelines.</li>
  </ul>

                <div class="job">
        
            <h3>Technical support analyst</h3>
            <p><strong>Company:</strong> Akkodis</p>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to be part of transformative projects that have shaped the technological landscape of major industries. Working with Modis, I played a critical role in the mass migration initiatives for JCI (Johnson Controls International) and Tyco Industries, where I gained invaluable experience in large-scale data migrations and systems integration. These projects demanded a deep understanding of infrastructure, meticulous planning, and a collaborative approach to ensure seamless transitions without disrupting business operations.

                Through these experiences, I've developed a strong skill set in project management, data migration strategies, and cross-functional teamwork. Being able to contribute to such pivotal projects has fueled my passion for innovation and has solidified my commitment to driving impactful technological solutions in every organization I serve. </p>
